# Fitness Tracker App - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A fitness tracking app that uses real-time geolocation to track running routes with:
- Session management (start/stop)
- Real-time map display 
- Live metrics (speed, duration, pace)
- Future dashboard with history and analytics

## Tech Stack
- Expo/React Native
- Mapbox for mapping
- NativeWind for styling
- SQLite for local storage

## Phase 1: Setup & Core Functionality

### 1. Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Expo project
- [x] Install required dependencies:
  - [x] `expo-location` for geolocation tracking
  - [x] `@rnmapbox/maps` for Mapbox integration
  - [x] `nativewind` and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [x] `expo-sqlite` for local data storage
  - [x] `expo-sensors` for additional motion data

### 2. Core Features Implementation
- [ ] Location Tracking Service
  - [ ] Create location tracking hook
  - [ ] Implement permission handling
  - [ ] Calculate speed, distance, and pace
  - [ ] Track GPS coordinates for route drawing

- [ ] Workout Session Management
  - [ ] Create session model (start time, end time, route data)
  - [ ] Implement start/stop functionality
  - [ ] Background tracking capability 

- [ ] Map Integration
  - [ ] Set up Mapbox component
  - [ ] Display real-time user location
  - [ ] Draw route path as user moves
  - [ ] Add map controls (zoom, center on user)

- [ ] Real-time Metrics Display
  - [ ] Create metrics component
  - [ ] Show current speed, pace, duration, distance
  - [ ] Add calorie estimation algorithm

- [ ] Data Persistence
  - [ ] Design SQLite schema for workouts
  - [ ] Create data service for CRUD operations
  - [ ] Implement session saving functionality

## Phase 2: UI Implementation
